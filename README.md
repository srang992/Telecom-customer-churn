# Telecom-customer-churn

Here I analyze and making a model on a dataset comes from an Iranian telecom company, with each row representing a customer over a year period. Along with a churn label, there is information on the customers' activity, such as call failures and subscription length.

This notebook covers **Retrieving data from a database**, **Data Manipulation**, **Computation**, **Handling Imbalanced Data** and **Visualization** as well as **Making a Machine Learning Model** for predicting whether a customer will churn or not.

I am using *Python* and a little *SQL* for the entire task.

It uses *Numpy* and *Pandas* for data manipulation, *Matplotlib* and *Seaborn* for visualization, *Scikit-Learn* for making the machine learning model and *Imblearn* for dealing with imbalanced data.
